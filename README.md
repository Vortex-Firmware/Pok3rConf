# Pok3rConf

**NOTE: This tool is currently a work in progress, and may not do anything! See [pok3rtool](https://github.com/pok3r-custom/pok3rtool) for flashing firmware from the command line.**

Pok3rConf allows flashing firmware to your keyboard. This is a GUI for [pok3rtool](https://github.com/pok3r-custom/pok3rtool). At the moment, only common commands from pok3rtool will be added. In the future, Pok3rConf will allow easy configuration of [KLL](https://input.club/kll/) once (if) support is added to pok3rtool.
